Description
-----------
FMRI_RV2  Modified RV coefficient between two multivariate brain datasets.
Computes the modified RV coefficient (RV2; Smilde et al., 2009) between
two voxel-by-time fMRI datasets. The coefficient quantifies similarity
between the time-by-time configuration matrices of the two datasets after
removing diagonal elements, which reduces the positive bias of the
classical RV coefficient in high-dimensional settings.
Each input is treated as a matrix of size [V x T], where rows are voxels
and columns are time points. For each dataset, voxel time series are
mean-centered across time, and a time-by-time configuration matrix is
computed as X' * X. The modified RV coefficient is then calculated from
the off-diagonal elements only.

Usage
-----
.. code-block:: matlab

    rv2 = fmri_rv2(vol1, vol2)

Inputs
------
- vol1, vol2  - Voxel-by-time matrices [V x T]. Both must have the same number of time points.

Outputs
-------
- **rv2**: Modified RV coefficient (scalar, range [-1 1]).

Examples
--------
.. code-block:: matlab

    rv2 = fmri_rv2(data_subj1, data_subj2);
